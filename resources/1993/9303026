A new trigonometric degeneration of the Sklyanin algebra is found and the
functional realization of its representations in space of polynomials in
one variable is studied. A further contraction gives the standard quantum
algebra $U_{q}(sl(2))$. It is shown that the degenerate Sklyanin algebra
contains a
subalgebra isomorphic to algebra of functions on the quantum sphere
$(SU(2)/SO(2))_{q^{1\over2}}$. The diagonalization of general quadratic form in
its generators leads in the functional realization to the difference equation
for Askey-Wilson polynomials.

\medskip
Sklyanin algebra (SA) [1] plays a very important role in the theory of
quantum integrable systems being the algebra of observables in the models
with elliptic R-matrix. It is the algebra with quadratic relations that follow
from the Yang-Baxter equation for quantum monodromy matrices. The trigonometric
degeneration of the R-matrix gives rise to a number of the well-known exactly
solvable models like XXZ spin chain, sine-Gordon, etc. In this case the SA
degenerates [2] to the quantum group $ U_{q}(sl(2))$ - deformation of the

universal enveloping algebra of $ sl(2)$ introduced by Kulish and Reshetikhin
[3]
and then extensively studied in more general mathematical context [4].

\par
In this Letter, we show that $U_{q}(sl(2))$ is a very particular case of a
more general family of trigonometric degenerations of the SA. More precisely,
the standard $U_{q}(sl(2)) $can be obtained as further contraction of the
degenerate SA. On the other hand, we show that the trigonometric limit of SA
contains a subalgebra isomorphic to $ Fun_{q^{1\over2}}(SU(2)/SO(2))$ - the
algebra of
functions on the quantum sphere$ (SU(2)/SO(2))_{q^{1\over2}}.$ The generator
sof this
algebra can be realized as difference operators acting on polynomials
in one variable. This realization follows directly from the representation
theory of SA [1]. We argue that the diagonalization problem for general
quadratic form in the generators (which is commonly interpreted as the
Hamiltonian of a proper physical system) is equivalent to the difference
Hamiltonian of a proper physical system) is equivalent to the differtence
equation for the Askey-Wilson polynomials [5]. In particular, the
diagonalization of the "$SO(2)$-invariant" element of
$Fun_{q^{1\over2}}(SU(2)/SO(2))$
(i.e. the generator of the commutative algebra

$Fun_{q^{1\over2}}({SO(2)}{\setminus}{SU(2)}{/}{SO(2)})$ leads to the
Rogers-Askey-Ismail

polynomials [6]. At the same time these polynomials are known to give zonal
spherical functions on the quantum spheres [7,8].

\par
The SA is the two-parametric deformation of $ U_{q}(gl(2))$. It is the
algebra with 4 generators $ S_{0}, S_{1}, S_{2}, S_{3}$ and the following
quadratic relations [1]:
\par
\begin{eqnarray}
 [S_{0},S_{\lambda}]=iJ_{\mu\nu}(S_{\mu},S_{\nu})\nonumber\\
 {[S_{\lambda},S_{\mu}]}=i(S_{0},S_{\nu})

\end{eqnarray}
 Here [,] and (,) are commutator and anticommutator respectively and

$(\lambda, \mu, \nu)$ stands for any cyclic permutation of $ (1,2,3)$. The
structure
constants $J_{\mu \nu}$ are parametrized as follows: $J_{\mu \nu}=(J_{\mu}-
J_{\lambda})/J_{\nu}$ where
\par
\begin {eqnarray}
 J_{1}=\theta_{4}(2\gamma)\theta_{4}(0)/(\theta_{4}(\gamma))^{2}\nonumber\\
 J_{2}=\theta_{3}(2\gamma)\theta_{3}(0)/(\theta_{3}(\gamma))^{2}\\

 J_{3}=\theta_{2}(2\gamma)\theta_{2}(0)/(\theta_{2}(\gamma))^{2}\nonumber

\end{eqnarray}
\par
 We use the standard notation [9] for the theta functions with elliptic nome
$h=exp(i\pi\tau)$. The two deformation parameters are just h and $\gamma$ they
are supposed to be real. The two central (Casimir) elements are given by
\par
\begin{eqnarray}
K_{0}=(S_{0})^{2}+(S_{1})^{2}+(S_{2})^{2}+(S_{3})^{2}\\

K_{1}=J_{1}(S_{1})^{2}+J_{2}(S_{2})^{2}+J_{3}(S_{3})^{2}\nonumber

\end{eqnarray}
 \noindent  Trigonometric degeneration of the SA can be obtained by tending h
to 0.
To do this let us redefine the generators as follows:
\par
\begin{eqnarray}
A=ih^{-1\over4}(S_{0}-tanh(\pi\gamma)S_{3})/(4sinh(\pi\gamma))\nonumber\\

D=ih^{-1\over4}(S_{0}+tanh(\pi\gamma)S_{3})/(4sinh(\pi\gamma))\\

C=ih^{+1\over4}(S_{1}-iS_{2})/(2sinh(2\pi\gamma))\nonumber\\

B=ih^{-3\over4}(S_{1}+iS_{2})/(8sinh(2\pi\gamma))\nonumber

\end{eqnarray}
\noindent We consider only the representations of series a) in terminology
[1].It follows
from the realization of the generators of SA by difference
operators [1] that these combinations have a finite limit when h goes to 0.
Substituting (4) into (1) and denoting $ q=exp(-2\pi\gamma) $ one obtains the
relations in the degenerate SA:
\par
\begin{eqnarray}
DC=qCD,  CA=qAC\\

{[A,D]}={1\over4}(q-q^{-1})^{3}C^{2}\\

{[B,C]}=(A^{2}-D^{2})/(q-q^{-1})\\

AB-qBA=qDB-BD=-({1\over4})(q^{2}-q^{-2})(DC-CA)

\end{eqnarray}
\noindent We would like to stress that though $ J_{12}=0 $ when $ h=0 $
and naively A and D would commute the careful limiting procedure taking into
account the
order
in h of each term in (1) gives just the nonvanishing commutator (6).
\par
According to the general representation theory of the SA developed in [1]
the finite dimensional irreducible representations of the limiting algebra
(5)-(8) are parametrized by a non-negative integer or half-integer number j
(spin of the representation). The spin-j representation can be realized in

(2j+1)-dimensional space of polynomials of degree 2j by the following
difference
operators:
\par
\begin{eqnarray}
C=({2\over(q-q^{-1})})({1\over(z-z^{-1})})(T_{+}-T_{-})\\

A=q^{-j}({1\over(z-z^{-1})})(zT_{+}-z^{-1}T_{-})\\

D=q^{j}({1\over(z-z^{-1})})(zT_{-}-z^{-1}T_{+})\\

B=({1\over(2(q-q^{-1})})({1\over(z-z^{-1})})(q^{2j}(z^{2}T_{-}-z^{-2}T_{+})-\\
  -q^{-2j}(z^{2}T_{+}-z^{-2}T_{-}) - (q+q^{-1})(T_{+}-T_{-})) \nonumber

\end{eqnarray}
\noindent where $T_{+}f(z)=f(qz), T_{-}f(z)=f(q^{-1}z)$. In the classical limit
$q=1$
(9-12) give the standard functional realization of the $sl(2)$-generators
C,B and $ H=(D-A)/(4\pi\gamma)$ by differential operators.
\par

It is remarkable that the standard quantum algebra $U_{q}(sl(2))$ can be
obtained from (5-8) by the contraction procedure: B to B, A to ${\epsilon}A$,
D to ${\epsilon}D$, C to $ {\epsilon}^{2}C$;$\epsilon \rightarrow 0$.
 For the representation (9-12) the contraction effectively means

that z goes to infinity and we can formally put $z^{-1}$ equal to 0
thus obtaining the well-known realization of $U_{q}(sl(2)) $in space of
holomorphic functions.
\par

One can see from (3) that the trigonometric limit of the central element
$K_{0}-K_{1}$ is proportional to $ AD+(1/4q)(q-q^{-1})^{2}C^{2}$. It follows
from (9-12) that the value of this Casimir element does not depend on j and
is equal to 1. Therefore, this operator can be put equal to 1:
\par
\begin{equation}
 AD+{1\over(4q)}(q-q^{-1})^{2}C^{2}=1

\end{equation}
\noindent This relation is to be added to (5-8).
\par

   Note that A,D,C generate the subalgebra with the relations (5),(6),(13).
Remarkably enough, it is isomorphic to the algebra of functions on the

quantum sphere $(SU(2)/SO(2))_{q^{1\over2}}$ [8] ( note this change of q to

$q^{1\over2}$!). Let us point out that the generator A+D $(the former S_{0})$
 corresponds under this isomorphysm to the simplest nontrivial element of

 $Fun_{q^{1\over2}}(SU(2)/SO(2))=F_{q^{1\over2}}$ invariant with respect to the
quasiregular action of the proper "twisted primitive element" [7] of
$U_{q^{1\over2}}(su(2))$ representing the "infinitesimal $SO(2)$-rotation".

In other words, the (commutative) algebra of functions on the double quantum

coset
space $ Fun_{q^{1\over2}}({SO(2)}{\setminus}{SU(2)}/{SO(2)})$ is generated by 1
and
A+D. The

operators (9-11) form a (reducible) representation of $F_{q^{1\over2}}$
\par

Now let us turn to the problem of diagonalization of a quadratic form
in generators of $F_{q^{1\over2}}$ in the space of spin-j representation of the
whole algebra (5-8). Such quadratic operator could be interpreted as the
Hamiltonian of a proper physical system. It is known [10,11] that in the
classical $sl(2)$ case all exactly solvable problems of quantum mechanics on
the line can be obtained in this way.
\par

   Consider the general quadratic form in A,D,C:
\par
\begin{eqnarray}
Q(r,k;\alpha,\beta)=q^{r}A^{2}+q^{-r}D^{2}-{1\over4}(q^{2k+1}+ \\
+q^{-2k-1})(q-q^{-1})^{2}C^{2}+(q-q^{-1})({\alpha}AC+{\beta}DC)\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent where $r,k,\alpha,\beta$ are arbitrary parameters. Substituting
(9-11) into (14)
we obtain the following eigenvalue equation for Laurent polynomials in z
$P_{m}(z)$:
\par
\begin{equation}
Q(r,k;\alpha,\beta)P_{m}(z)=E_{m}P_{m}(z)

\end{equation}
\noindent One can see that when $E_{m}=q^{2(j-m)-r}+q^{-2(j-m)+r} $ (15)
coincides with
the difference equation for Askey-Wilson polynomials

$P_{m}({(z+z^{-1})\over2}; a,b,c,d|q^{2})$ (=$P_{m}(z)$ for brievity)
\par
\begin{eqnarray}
A(z)(P_{m}(q^{2}z)-P_{m}(z)) + A(z^{-1})(P_{m}(q^{-2}z)-P_{m}(z))=\\

= (q^{-2m}-1)(1-abcdq^{2m-1})P_{m}(z)\nonumber

\end{eqnarray}
\noindent where
$A(z)=(1-az)(1-bz)(1-cz)(1-dz)/((1-z^{2})(1-q^{2}z^{2}))$
and the parameters a,b,c,d are expressed through $ r,k,\alpha,\beta $ as
follows:
\par
\begin{eqnarray}
(1-az)(1-bz)(1-cz)(1-dz)=1+{2\beta}q^{r+1-j}-\\

%% FOLLOWING LINE CANNOT BE BROKEN BEFORE 80 CHAR
-(q^{2k+1}+q^{-2k-1})q^{r+1-2j}z^{2}+{2\alpha}q^{r+1-3j}z^{3}+q^{2r+2-4j}z^{4}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
\noindent  In particular, for $ r=k=\alpha=\beta=0 $ we have $
Q(0,0,0,0)=(A+D)^{2}-2$
and (16)
reduces to the equation for the Rogers-Askey-Ismail polynomials
$C_{m}((z+z^{-1})/2; q^{-2j}|q^{2})$ [6] which are also known as Macdonald's
polynomials for the root system $A_{1} $[12]. So the eigenfunctions of the
$SO(2)$-invariant element of $F_{q^{1\over2}}$ discussed above are expressed in
terms
of these polynomials. We note also that at the same time the Askey-Wilson
polynomials (with particular values of the parameters) provide the most
general family of zonal spherical functions on the quantum group
$U_{q}(su(2))$ [7].
\par
In conclusion let us make a few remarks. The diagonalization of a more
general quadratic form in all the generators including B leads to a more
complicated eigenvalue difference equation corresponding to the so-called
quasi-exactly solvable problems [11] in the classical limit. In case of the
contraction to $ U_{q}(sl(2))$ the little Jacobi polynomials appear.
\par
The role of the  quadratic algebra (5-8) (obtained as a result of the
limiting procedure from the SA) in integrable models with trigonometric
R-matrix is not clear enough at the moment. However, as it was shown in
[13] the scatetring of dressed excitations in the XXZ antiferromagnetic spin
chain can be described in terms of zonal spherical elements of the algebra
of functions on the quantum sphere and/or hyperboloid.
